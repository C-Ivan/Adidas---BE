Adidas Tech Challenge - QA - BE
Iván Cañete

The challenge is implemented in the petStore.feature

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commands to execute the tests from the terminal:

mvn clean test

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reports are automatically generated after each execution, a new folder will be created in the root of the project, with the following format:
CucumberExtent-Reports {date} {hour}

Inside this folder will be a Spark.html file with said report (In IntelliJ I have to manually refresh the project to see the generated folder)
